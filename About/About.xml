[h1]Mod Version: v1.0[/h1]


This mod adds 11 new minable gemstones, as well as the worktables (requires research) needed to craft the uncut gems into cut gems.

Gemstones can be used to craft structures, furniture and even weapons. Cut gemstones are worth more than their uncut variants and can even be used to earn royal favor.

[b]Compatibility:[/b]
[list]
[*]Save Game Compatible
[*]Will not play nice with other gemstone mods without a patch.
[*][b][Major Incompatibility - Simple Sidearms][/b] Overrides the way bladelink weapons work and breaks the no-bond mechanics of arcane weapons. <biocodeOnEquip> can be turned on in settings as a workaround, but will re-introduce the bonding mechanic.
[/list]
[i]Dr Zhivago's [b]DocUniversalResources[/b] (DUR) will address resource overlaps for mod compatibility when it is finished.[/i]



[b]Balance & Bug Reports:[/b]
Gems are intentionally sparse and not easy to obtain through natural means, but they can also be purchased from traders or obtained from salvaging certain objects.

Balance feedbacks are welcomed, please provide context when doing so.
Bug reports must come with HugsLogs, join the Discord if you don't know how to generate one.
